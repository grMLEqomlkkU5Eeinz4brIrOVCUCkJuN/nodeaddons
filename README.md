# Node.js Addons Playground

This repo is where I'm learning how Node.js addons work.

I'm experimenting with native modules (mostly using N-API and C++) to understand how to extend Node.js beyond JavaScript. Right now, I'm still figuring things out, but I'm starting to build my own small libraries as I go.

Nothing here is final, so it's all just part of the learning process.
